# WebEditRun TODO list

* Clean up side-by-side configuration
* add config cols x rows in URL param
* make stand alone web page configurator form  (creates all URL params as link)
* Make stand alone editor on deftio.com/webeditrun
* Update makefile for updating bitwrench, ace depedancies from their NPM etc
* add rich HTML editor (synchronous with code--HTML)



## Thinking
The whole point of this repo is to allow WebEditRun to be cloned in to other repos which need local live demo edits (e.g. spannit or bitwrench or other developer's tasks etc).  
Perhaps add a mini workflow app here.
--> [HTML Page editor] ==> [live rich editor (synchronous)

--> [ live code run area (full frame)]


## Misc
hide print line:
editor.setShowPrintMargin(false);
